# DESIGN TARGET — HUSTLEXP v1.0

**STATUS: CONSTITUTIONAL — AESTHETIC AUTHORITY**
**PURPOSE: Define what "max-tier" visually and experientially means**
**ENFORCEMENT: All UI must plausibly belong in this reference class**

---

## WHY THIS EXISTS

UAP gates ensure correctness.
This document ensures **excellence**.

Passing constraints is not enough.
The product must feel like it belongs with the **top 1% of consumer apps**.

Without this document, AI converges to:
> "The safest solution that passes all gates"

With this document, AI converges to:
> "The solution that matches elite reference class"

## THE REFERENCE CLASS (MUST FEEL LIKE)

HustleXP UI must feel closer to these products:

### Tier 1: Primary References (Match This Energy)

| Product | Why It's Reference |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Uber** (rider app) | Urgency, real-world immediacy, "something is happening now" |
| **Cash App** | Bold, confident, unapologetic about money |
| **Duolingo** | Streak energy, momentum, "you're in a system" |
| **Apple Fitness+** | Premium motion, deliberate progression, earned achievement |
| **Discord** (mobile) | Community presence, living feed, "people are here" |

### Tier 2: Secondary References (Borrow From)

| Product | What To Borrow |
|---------|----------------|
| **Stripe Dashboard** | Information density done right, professional without boring |
| **Linear** | Keyboard-first urgency, everything feels fast |
| **Figma** | Collaborative presence, multiplayer energy |
| **Nike Run Club** | Achievement celebration, personal records matter |
| **Robinhood** | Numbers that feel alive, real-time energy |

### Tier 3: Aspirational References (Aim For)

| Product | Aspirational Quality |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Apple Vision Pro onboarding** | Spatial presence, entering a world |
| **Call of Duty lobby** | Pre-action tension, "something is about to happen" |
| **Tesla app** | Your machine is waiting, connected power |

---

## THE EXCLUSION CLASS (MUST NOT FEEL LIKE)

HustleXP must **explicitly avoid** resembling:

### Hard Exclusions (Automatic Fail)

| Pattern | Why It's Excluded |
|---------|------------------|
| **Generic SaaS landing pages** | "Get started with our platform" energy |
| **Crypto wallet splash screens** | Abstract orbs, vague promises |
| **Meditation/wellness apps** | Calm, contemplative, passive |
| **Dribbble showcase UI** | Looks good in screenshot, feels empty in hand |
| **Enterprise B2B dashboards** | Dense, utilitarian, no personality |
| **Banking apps** | Sterile, trustworthy-but-boring |

### Soft Exclusions (Strong Avoid)

| Pattern | Why It's Avoided |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Centered hero + single CTA** | Every startup does this |
| **Abstract gradient backgrounds** | Pretty but meaningless |
| **"Welcome to [App]"** | Says nothing |
| **Onboarding carousels** | User skips immediately |
| **Floating UI with no ground** | Feels disconnected from reality |

## BRAND ENERGY DEFINITION

HustleXP is NOT:
- Calm
- Patient
- Contemplative
- Abstract
- Passive

HustleXP IS:
- **Urgent** — Things are happening now
- **Concrete** — Real tasks, real money, real people
- **Momentum-driven** — You're always moving forward
- **Earned** — XP comes from action, not time
- **Local** — Tasks are nearby, people are real

### The Emotional Sequence

Every screen should feel like:

```
1. ARRIVAL    → You've entered a system that's already running
2. PRESENCE   → Other people are here, things are happening
3. OPPORTUNITY → There's something you can do right now
4. MOMENTUM   → Action leads to visible progress
```

---

## ENTRY SCREEN SPECIFIC TARGET

The entry screen is the **most important 3 seconds**.

### It Must Communicate (In Order):

1. **Power** — This is not a toy app
2. **Motion** — Something is already happening
3. **Opportunity** — You can act right now
4. **Urgency** — Why wait?

### It Must NOT Communicate:

- "Welcome to our app"
- "Here's what we do"
- "Get started when you're ready"
- Contemplation
- Patience

### Reference Match Test

Ask: "Could this screen be the entry to Uber? Cash App? Duolingo?"

If no → It's not max-tier.

---

## COPY ENERGY REQUIREMENTS

### Headlines Must:
- Imply action or outcome
- Create tension or urgency
- Be specific, not abstract

### Headlines Must NOT:
- Describe the app
- Welcome the user
- Use passive voice
- Be interchangeable with competitors

### CTA Buttons Must:
- State what happens next
- Imply momentum
- Feel like entering, not starting

### CTA Buttons Must NOT:
- Say "Get Started"
- Say "Continue"
- Say "Next"
- Be ambiguous about outcome

---

## MOTION REQUIREMENTS

### Motion Must Be:
- **Directional** — Moving toward something
- **Purposeful** — Indicating state or progress
- **Responsive** — Reacting to user presence

### Motion Must NOT Be:
- Decorative loops
- Ambient glow
- "Pretty for screenshots"
- Disconnected from meaning

---

## VISUAL DENSITY REQUIREMENTS

### Entry/Onboarding Screens:
- Low density, high impact
- Every element earns its space
- Negative space is intentional

### Feed/List Screens:
- High density, scannable
- Information-rich without clutter
- Real data, not placeholders

### Action Screens:
- Focused, single-purpose
- Clear primary action
- Minimal distraction

---

## THE BENCHMARK TEST

Before any screen ships, ask:

```
1. Could this screen appear in Uber/Cash App/Duolingo?
   → If no: Not max-tier

2. Would a designer at Apple/Stripe approve this?
   → If uncertain: Not max-tier

3. Does this feel like a $1B company's app?
   → If no: Not max-tier

4. Would you screenshot this to show someone?
   → If no: Not max-tier
```

All four must be YES.

## ENFORCEMENT

This document is referenced by:
- `PER/UI_ACCEPTANCE_PROTOCOL.md` (UAP-6)
- `PER/DESIGN_AUTHORITY.md` (Entry screen lock)
- `.cursorrules` (Frontend rules)

**A screen that passes UAP-1 through UAP-5 but fails Design Target is INVALID.**

## THE GUARANTEE

With this document, the system guarantees:

| Guarantee | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| No generic startup UI | Exclusion class defined |
| No "safe but boring" | Reference class required |
| No decorative motion | Purposeful motion required |
| No weak copy | Energy requirements defined |
| No ambiguous CTA | Outcome-oriented required |

**This is not about taste.**
**This is about encoding taste so AI can match it.**
**Max-tier is now mechanically verifiable.**
