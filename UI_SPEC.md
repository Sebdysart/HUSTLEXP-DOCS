# HustleXP UI Specification v1.4.0

**STATUS: CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY — MAX-TIER COMPLETE**  
**Owner:** HustleXP Core  
**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Governance:** This document governs all visual expression. Violations are build failures.

**Max-Tier Status:** ✅ All 7 human systems gaps integrated (GAP-1 through GAP-7, excluding global fatigue for GAP-5 per product decision)

---

## §1. Foundational Principles

### 1.1 UI Authority

The UI has **zero decision authority**.

Per ARCHITECTURE.md §2.5:
- UI may render state
- UI may request actions
- UI may **never** compute, decide, or assume

If the UI displays something the server didn't confirm, the UI is lying.

### 1.2 Expression vs Authority

| Layer | Role | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| Database | Truth | `escrow.state = 'RELEASED'` |
| Backend | Decision | "Release escrow because task completed" |
| UI | Expression | Green checkmark + "Payment sent" |

The UI **expresses** decisions made elsewhere. It does not make them.

### 1.3 What This Spec Is Not

This spec does **not** define:
- ❌ Component libraries
- ❌ CSS frameworks
- ❌ Design system tokens
- ❌ Marketing aesthetics
- ❌ Brand guidelines

Those are implementation details. This spec defines **behavioral constraints**.

---

## §2. Color Authority

### 2.1 Semantic Color Categories

Colors in HustleXP have **meaning**. They are not decorative.

| Category | Semantic Meaning | Usage |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| **XP** | Earned value, progression | XP displays, level indicators, streak counters |
| **MONEY** | Financial state | Escrow status, payment amounts, wallet |
| **STATUS** | System state | Success, warning, error, info |
| **NEUTRAL** | No semantic meaning | Backgrounds, borders, disabled states |

### 2.2 XP Colors

```
XP_PRIMARY:    #10B981 (Emerald 500)
XP_SECONDARY:  #34D399 (Emerald 400)
XP_BACKGROUND: #D1FAE5 (Emerald 100)
XP_ACCENT:     #059669 (Emerald 600)
```

**Allowed Contexts:**
- XP amount displays
- Level badges
- Streak indicators
- Progression bars
- Level-up celebrations

**Forbidden Contexts:**
- Task cards (before completion)
- Escrow states
- Navigation elements
- Generic buttons
- Error states

**Violation:** Using XP colors outside XP context implies unearned value.

### 2.3 Money Colors

```
MONEY_POSITIVE: #10B981 (Green - incoming)
MONEY_NEGATIVE: #EF4444 (Red - outgoing)
MONEY_NEUTRAL:  #6B7280 (Gray - pending)
MONEY_LOCKED:   #F59E0B (Amber - disputed)
```

**Allowed Contexts:**
- Escrow state indicators
- Payment amounts
- Wallet balances
- Transaction history

**Forbidden Contexts:**
- XP displays
- Task descriptions
- User profiles (except earnings)
- Decorative elements

**Violation:** Using money colors decoratively trivializes financial state.

### 2.4 Status Colors

```
SUCCESS: #10B981 (Confirmation, completion)
WARNING: #F59E0B (Attention needed, caution)
ERROR:   #EF4444 (Failure, rejection, danger)
INFO:    #3B82F6 (Neutral information)
```

**Usage Rules:**
- SUCCESS: Only after server confirms positive outcome
- WARNING: Only for actionable caution states
- ERROR: Only for actual failures, never for emphasis
- INFO: Only for neutral system messages

**Forbidden:**
- Using ERROR for visual emphasis
- Using SUCCESS before server confirmation
- Using WARNING for non-actionable decoration

### 2.5 Color Authority Violations

| Violation | Example | Consequence |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| XP color in non-XP context | Green task card | ESLint error |
| Money color decoratively | Green "Post Task" button | ESLint error |
| Success before confirmation | Optimistic green checkmark | Runtime guard blocks |
| Error for emphasis | Red "limited time" text | ESLint error |

---

## §3. Animation Constraints

### 3.1 Animation Authority

Animations may **never**:
- Imply state changes that haven't occurred
- Play without server-confirmed trigger
- Create false urgency
- Manipulate user decisions

Animations may:
- Acknowledge confirmed state changes
- Provide feedback for user actions
- Guide attention appropriately
- Enhance comprehension

### 3.2 Forbidden Animation Patterns

| Pattern | Why Forbidden | Alternative |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Confetti** | Casino psychology, dopamine manipulation | Subtle glow or pulse |
| **Infinite loops** | Attention hijacking | Single-play with natural end |
| **Randomized motion** | Unpredictable = untrustworthy | Deterministic easing |
| **Shake/vibrate** | Aggressive, anxiety-inducing | Color change or border |
| **Slot machine reveals** | Gambling association | Direct state display |
| **Countdown urgency** | False scarcity manipulation | Static deadline display |

### 3.3 Animation Duration Limits

| Animation Type | Maximum Duration | Notes |
|----------------|------------------|-------|
| Micro-feedback | 150ms | Button press, toggle |
| State transition | 300ms | Screen change, modal |
| Celebration | 2000ms | Level up, badge unlock |
| Loading | Indefinite | But must show progress |

**Rule:** No animation may exceed 2 seconds without user-initiated continuation.

### 3.4 Animation Sequencing

When multiple animations could occur:

1. **Priority order:** Error → Success → Info → Celebration
2. **Queue limit:** Maximum 2 queued animations
3. **Interruption:** Errors interrupt celebrations, never reverse

**Example:**
```
User completes task (celebration queued)
  → Server returns error (error displays immediately)
  → Celebration cancelled (not queued behind error)
```

### 3.5 Celebration Constraints

Celebrations are permitted for:
- Level up (first time only)
- Badge unlock (first time only)
- Trust tier promotion
- Milestone completion (10th task, etc.)

Celebrations are **forbidden** during:
- Active disputes
- Pending payments
- Error states
- Onboarding (before role lock)

**First-Time Rule:** Celebration animations play **exactly once** per achievement per user. Server tracks via `animation_shown_at` field.

### 3.6 Reduced Motion

When user has `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`:

- All animations become instant state changes
- No exceptions for "important" animations
- Loading spinners become progress bars
- Celebrations become static badges

**Enforcement:** Runtime guard checks system setting before any animation.

---

## §4. Badge Visual System

### 4.1 Tier-Material Binding

Badge visuals are **permanently bound** to trust tiers.

| Tier | Material | Visual Treatment |
|------|----------|------------------|
| ROOKIE | Matte | Flat color, no effects |
| VERIFIED | Metallic | Subtle gradient, soft shine |
| TRUSTED | Holographic | Animated gradient, premium |

**Rule:** A ROOKIE badge may **never** have metallic or holographic treatment, regardless of "design preference."

### 4.2 Badge State Rules

| State | Visual | Animation |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Locked | Grayscale silhouette | None |
| Unlocked (new) | Full color + glow | Unlock animation (once) |
| Unlocked (seen) | Full color | None |
| Highlighted | Full color + subtle pulse | On hover/focus only |

### 4.3 Badge Permanence

Per ARCHITECTURE.md §5.2, badges cannot be revoked.

**UI implication:** There is no "lost badge" or "revoked badge" visual state. The concept does not exist.

If a badge was granted in error:
- Backend marks it with `revoked_reason`
- UI shows badge with small indicator
- Tooltip explains correction
- Badge remains visible (transparency)

### 4.4 Animation Replay Prevention

Badge unlock animations are controlled server-side:

```
badges.animation_shown_at = NULL  → Animation plays, then client confirms
badges.animation_shown_at = <ts>  → No animation, static display
```

**Flow:**
1. Client fetches badge with `animation_shown_at = NULL`
2. Client plays unlock animation
3. Client calls `confirmBadgeAnimation(badgeId)`
4. Server sets `animation_shown_at = NOW()`
5. Future loads show static badge

This prevents:
- Animation on every app launch
- Animation on multiple devices
- Animation without actual unlock

---

## §5. Copy & Language

### 5.1 Tone Requirements

HustleXP copy is:
- **Clear:** No jargon, no ambiguity
- **Respectful:** No condescension, no shame
- **Honest:** No manipulation, no false urgency
- **Professional:** No slang, no excessive enthusiasm

### 5.2 Forbidden Copy Patterns

| Pattern | Example | Why Forbidden | Alternative |
|---------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Shame** | "You haven't completed any tasks yet 😢" | Psychological manipulation | "0 tasks completed" |
| **False urgency** | "Complete NOW before it's gone!" | Manufactured pressure | "Deadline: Jan 15" |
| **Guilt** | "Don't let them down!" | Emotional manipulation | "Task awaiting completion" |
| **Excessive praise** | "AMAZING!!! You're incredible!!!" | Hollow, patronizing | "Task completed" |
| **Vague threats** | "Your account may be affected" | Anxiety without clarity | Specific consequence |
| **Dark patterns** | "Are you sure you want to miss out?" | Manipulation | "Cancel task?" |

### 5.3 Error Message Standards

Error messages must be:
- **Specific:** What failed
- **Actionable:** What user can do
- **Blameless:** No "you did X wrong"

**Bad:**
```
"Error: Invalid input. Please try again."
```

**Good:**
```
"Task price must be at least $5. Current: $3."
```

### 5.4 Confirmation Message Standards

Confirmations must:
- State what happened
- Not over-celebrate
- Include relevant details

**Bad:**
```
"🎉 AWESOME!!! You did it! You're amazing!"
```

**Good:**
```
"Payment sent: $42.50 to @worker_jane"
```

### 5.5 Empty State Standards

Empty states must:
- Acknowledge the empty state clearly
- Provide next action (if applicable)
- Not shame or guilt

**Bad:**
```
"Looks lonely here... 😢 Why not post a task?"
```

**Good:**
```
"No tasks yet. [Post a Task]"
```

## §6. Screen-Specific Rules

### 6.1 Screen Context Matrix

| Screen | XP Colors | Money Colors | Celebrations | Disputes Visible |
|--------|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Home/Dashboard | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed | ❌ Hidden |
| Task Feed | ❌ Forbidden | ❌ Forbidden | ❌ Forbidden | ❌ Hidden |
| Task Detail | ❌ Forbidden | ✅ Allowed | ❌ Forbidden | ⚠️ If applicable |
| Wallet | ❌ Forbidden | ✅ Required | ❌ Forbidden | ❌ Hidden |
| Profile | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed | ❌ Hidden |
| Dispute | ❌ Forbidden | ✅ Allowed | ❌ Forbidden | ✅ Required |
| Onboarding | ❌ Forbidden | ❌ Forbidden | ❌ Forbidden | ❌ Hidden |

### 6.2 Onboarding Screen Rules

During onboarding (before role lock):
- No XP colors (user hasn't earned anything)
- No money colors (no transactions yet)
- No celebrations (nothing to celebrate)
- No badges (none unlocked)
- Minimal animation (professional tone)

**Rationale:** Onboarding sets expectations. Premature rewards teach users to expect unearned dopamine.

### 6.3 Dispute Screen Rules

During active disputes:
- No celebrations (inappropriate context)
- No XP displays (outcome uncertain)
- Neutral color palette
- Clear, factual copy only
- Evidence displayed without editorializing

### 6.4 Task Feed Rules

Task feed is **neutral territory**:
- No XP colors (tasks aren't XP)
- No success colors (nothing succeeded yet)
- Price displayed in neutral gray
- No urgency indicators
- No "hot" or "trending" manipulation

---

## §7. Accessibility Requirements

### 7.1 Non-Negotiable Standards

| Requirement | Standard | Enforcement |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Color contrast | WCAG 2.1 AA (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI) | Automated testing |
| Touch targets | Minimum 44×44 points | Component constraint |
| Focus indicators | Visible on all interactive elements | Runtime check |
| Screen reader | All content accessible | Manual audit |
| Reduced motion | Respected system-wide | Runtime guard |

### 7.2 Color Independence

Information must **never** be conveyed by color alone.

**Bad:**
```
● Green = Success
● Red = Error
(No other indicator)
```

**Good:**
```
✓ Success (green)
✗ Error (red)
(Icon + color)
```

### 7.3 Animation Alternatives

Every animation must have a non-animated equivalent:

| Animation | Reduced Motion Alternative |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Loading spinner | Progress bar with percentage |
| Success checkmark animation | Static checkmark |
| Badge unlock | Static badge with "New" label |
| Level up celebration | Static level display |

  context: object;
  timestamp: Date;
  severity: 'WARNING' | 'ERROR';
}
```

Violations are:
- Logged locally (development)
- Reported to monitoring (production)
- Aggregated for audit (weekly)

## §9. State Display Rules

### 9.1 Never Display Unconfirmed State

**Rule:** UI may not display state that the server has not confirmed.

**Bad:**
```javascript
// Optimistic update
setTaskState('COMPLETED');
await api.task.complete(taskId);
```

**Good:**
```javascript
const result = await api.task.complete(taskId);
setTaskState(result.state); // Server-confirmed
```

### 9.2 Loading States

When awaiting server response:
- Show loading indicator (spinner, skeleton)
- Disable interactive elements
- Never show "assumed" state

**Minimum loading time:** 100ms (prevent flash)
**Maximum before timeout UI:** 10s

### 9.3 Error States

When server returns error:
- Display error immediately
- Clear any optimistic state
- Provide retry action (if applicable)
- Log violation if optimistic state was shown

### 9.4 Stale State Indicators

If data may be stale (offline, cached):
- Show subtle "Last updated: X" indicator
- Disable actions that require fresh state
- Provide manual refresh action

## §13. Live Mode UI Rules

Live Mode requires distinct visual treatment to communicate real-time state without creating panic or exploitation.

### 13.1 Mode Indicator Colors

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `LIVE_INDICATOR` | `#EF4444` (Red-500) | Live badge, active broadcast |

## §14. Money Timeline (Financial Legibility)

The Money Timeline transforms HustleXP from a gig app into a **financial planning tool**.

### 14.1 Core Principle

Users don't churn because of UX. They churn because they feel **financially blind**.

The Money Timeline answers:
- What money do I have **now**?
- What money is **coming**?
- What money is **blocked**?

### 14.2 Money Timeline UI

## §15. Failure Recovery UX

When things go wrong, users need **explanation, not punishment**.

### 15.1 Core Principle

Every negative outcome has:
1. Clear explanation of what happened
2. Concrete impact (if any)
3. Specific next step
4. **No shame language**

### 15.2 Failure Screen Template

## §16. Session Forecast (AI Earning Predictability)

Hustlers earn and progress, but they don't **predict**. Best gig money apps answer: "If I open this app for 90 minutes, what happens?"

### 16.1 Core Principle

AI predicts earning potential based on:
- Current location
- Historical performance
- Current demand
- Time of day

**AI authority: A1 (Advisory)** — forecasts are read-only, cannot make decisions.

### 16.2 Session Forecast UI

```

### 16.3 Forecast Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Forecasts are ranges** | "$35–$55" not "$45" (always show range) |
| **No guarantees** | Always include disclaimer ("This is an estimate, not a guarantee.") |
| **Accuracy improves** | More history = better predictions |
| **AI is advisory** | Cannot auto-accept tasks, cannot change task visibility |

### 16.4 Forecast Display Rules

**REQUIRED:**
- Always show earnings as a range (low-high)
- Always include disclaimer
- Show confidence level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
- Show best opportunities (task categories)
- Show conditions (POOR, FAIR, GOOD, EXCELLENT)

**FORBIDDEN:**
- Exact dollar amounts without ranges ("You will earn $45")
- Guarantees or promises ("Guaranteed earnings", "You will definitely...")
- Auto-accept suggestions ("Accept these tasks now!")
- Manipulation ("Limited time forecast", "Act now!")

### 16.5 Forecast Invariants

| ID | Invariant | Enforcement |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| **FORECAST-1** | Forecasts are always ranges, never exact numbers | UI component |
| **FORECAST-2** | Disclaimers required on all forecasts | Copy review |
| **FORECAST-3** | AI cannot auto-accept tasks based on forecast | Backend guard |
| **FORECAST-4** | Forecasts are read-only (no user input) | UI component |
| **FORECAST-5** | No guarantees or promises in forecast copy | Copy review |

### 16.6 Session Forecast Component Rules

**Display Context:**
- ✅ HomeScreen (Hustler view, post-unlock)
- ✅ Task Feed (optional, can be collapsed)
- ❌ Task Detail (not relevant)
- ❌ Wallet (financial context, not forecast)

**Color Rules:**
- Use INFO color (#3B82F6) for forecast header
- Use neutral gray for earnings range (not XP or Money colors)
- Use status colors for conditions (🟢 GOOD, 🟡 FAIR, 🔴 POOR)

### 16.7 Forbidden Forecast Patterns

```javascript
const FORBIDDEN_FORECAST_COPY = [
  // Guarantees
  'Guaranteed', 'Definitely', 'Will earn', 'Promise',
  
  // Exact amounts
  'You will earn $45', 'Exact earnings: $50',
  
  // Auto-suggestions
  'Accept now', 'Take these tasks', 'Auto-accept',
  
  // Manipulation
  'Limited time', 'Act now', 'Hurry', 'Don't miss'
];

const REQUIRED_FORECAST_ELEMENTS = [
  'Earnings range',     // Always show low-high
  'Disclaimer',         // Always include
  'Best opportunities', // Task categories
  'Conditions',         // Demand level
  'Confidence level'    // LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH

## §17. Private Percentile Status

Leaderboards destroy gig platforms through toxic competition. But **status** still matters for motivation.

### 17.1 Core Principle

Show users their relative standing **without** public ranks, usernames, or competition.

**Private only** — never visible to other users.

### 17.2 Private Percentile UI

### 17.3 Private Percentile Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **No usernames** | Never compare to named users ("You're better than @username") |
| **No rankings** | Never show "You are #47" or "Rank: 47th" |
| **No competition** | Never "Beat X to unlock Y" or "Compete with others" |
| **Only self-relative** | Compare to your own history, not others |
| **Private only** | Never visible to other users (API guard) |

### 17.4 Percentile Metrics

| Metric | Calculation | Shown To |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Reliability** | Tasks completed / Tasks accepted | Hustler only |
| **Response Time** | Avg time to accept tasks | Hustler only |
| **Completion Rate** | Successful / Total tasks | Hustler only |
| **Earnings Velocity** | Earnings / Active hours | Hustler only |

**Display Format:**
- "Top X%" (never "Bottom X%" or "Xth percentile")
- Progress bar visualization (visual only, no numbers on bar)
- "this week", "this month", "all time" context

### 17.5 Percentile Invariants

| ID | Invariant | Enforcement |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| **PERC-1** | Percentiles are never public | API guard (403 if not own user) |
| **PERC-2** | No comparison to named users | UI review |
| **PERC-3** | Percentiles update weekly max | Backend job (not real-time) |
| **PERC-4** | Minimum 100 users for percentile | Statistical validity (backend) |
| **PERC-5** | No rankings or position numbers | UI component |

### 17.6 Private Percentile Display Rules

**Display Context:**
- ✅ ProfileScreen (Hustler view, post-unlock)
- ✅ HomeScreen (optional, can be collapsed)
- ❌ Task Feed (not relevant)
- ❌ Task Detail (not relevant)
- ❌ Any public view (never visible to others)

**Color Rules:**
- Use XP_PRIMARY (#10B981) for progress bars (this is XP-related status)
- Use neutral gray for text labels
- Use SUCCESS color for "Top X%" text when X < 25 (high percentile)

**Forbidden:**
- Leaderboard-style lists
- Comparison to other users
- Competitive language
- Public visibility

### 17.7 Forbidden Percentile Patterns

```javascript
const FORBIDDEN_PERCENTILE_COPY = [
  // Rankings
  'You are #47', 'Rank: 47th', 'Position: 47',
  
  // Comparisons
  'Better than @username', 'Top of your class', 'Beat others',
  
  // Competition
  'Compete', 'Challenge', 'Leaderboard', 'Tournament',
  
  // Public visibility
  'Visible to others', 'Public ranking', 'Your rank'
];

const REQUIRED_PERCENTILE_ELEMENTS = [
  'Top X% format',       // Always "Top X%", never "Bottom X%"
  'Privacy notice',      // "Only you can see this"
  'Time context',        // "this week", "this month", "all time"
  'Progress bar',        // Visual representation (no numbers on bar)
  'Self-relative only'   // Compare to own history, not others
];
```

## §18. Poster Quality Filtering (Hustler-Only)

Escrow protects hustlers from non-payment. But not yet from **bad posters** who dispute unfairly, communicate poorly, or create unclear tasks.

### 18.1 Core Principle

Surface poster history **only to hustlers**, not to posters themselves.

**Never show to posters** — would change their behavior artificially.

### 18.2 Poster Reputation UI (Task Card)

```

```

### 18.3 Poster Reputation Metrics

| Metric | Calculation | Visible To |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Tasks Posted** | COUNT(tasks) where poster_id = user.id | Hustlers only |
| **Dispute Rate** | Disputes / Tasks (rolling 90-day) | Hustlers only |
| **Avg Response Time** | Avg time to respond to proofs (hours) | Hustlers only |
| **Hustler Rating** | Avg rating from workers (GREAT, OKAY, DIFFICULT) | Hustlers only |
| **Repeat Hire Rate** | Rehired same hustler % | Hustlers only |

**Display Format:**
- Factual, neutral language ("12 tasks posted", not "12 successful tasks")
- Hustler rating shown as emoji + text ("⭐ Excellent", "😐 Okay", "😕 Difficult")
- No subjective labels ("bad poster", "problematic", etc.)

### 18.4 Poster Reputation Rules

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| **Never show to posters** | Would change their behavior artificially (gaming the system) |
| **Minimum 5 tasks** | Statistical validity (don't show if < 5 tasks) |
| **Rolling 90-day window** | Recent behavior matters more than lifetime |
| **No "bad poster" label** | Just facts, hustler decides |
| **Hustler-only visibility** | API guard (403 if poster tries to view own reputation) |

### 18.5 Poster Rating System (Post-Task)

After task completion (COMPLETED state), hustler can rate poster:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  How was working with Sarah?                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                         │
│  [ 😊 Great ]  [ 😐 Okay ]  [ 😕 Difficult ]          │
│                                                         │
│  Optional: What could be better?                        │
│  [ ] Clearer task description                           │
│  [ ] Faster communication                               │
│  [ ] More reasonable expectations                       │
│  [ ] Better task location                               │
│                                                         │
│  [ Submit Rating ]                                      │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rating Options:**
- **😊 Great** — Smooth experience, would work with again
- **😐 Okay** — Acceptable, no major issues
- **😕 Difficult** — Issues with communication, clarity, or expectations

**Feedback Flags (Optional):**
- Clearer task description
- Faster communication
- More reasonable expectations
- Better task location
- Fair payment
- Respectful interaction

**Rating Rules:**
- Only after task COMPLETED (not during dispute)
- 7-day window (auto-rate as "Okay" after 7 days if no rating)
- One rating per task per hustler
- Poster never sees individual ratings (only aggregated reputation)

### 18.6 Poster Reputation Invariants

| ID | Invariant | Enforcement |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| **POSTER-1** | Poster reputation never visible to posters | API guard (403) |
| **POSTER-2** | Minimum 5 tasks required for reputation display | Backend query |
| **POSTER-3** | Only rolling 90-day window (no lifetime stats) | Backend query |
| **POSTER-4** | Facts only, no subjective labels | UI component |
| **POSTER-5** | Poster ratings are aggregated, never individual | Backend aggregation |
| **POSTER-6** | Rating only available after task COMPLETED | State machine guard |

### 18.7 Poster Reputation Display Rules

**Display Context:**
- ✅ Task Card (Task Feed, Search results)
- ✅ Task Detail Screen (before accepting)
- ❌ ProfileScreen (posters never see own reputation)
- ❌ Public views (never visible to anyone except hustlers viewing tasks)

**Color Rules:**
- Use INFO color (#3B82F6) for "POSTER HISTORY" header
- Use neutral gray for metrics (tasks posted, disputes, response time)
- Use status colors for hustler rating:
  - 😊 Great → SUCCESS (#10B981)
  - 😐 Okay → INFO (#3B82F6)
  - 😕 Difficult → WARNING (#F59E0B)

**Forbidden:**
- Subjective labels ("bad poster", "problematic", "avoid this poster")
- Lifetime stats (only 90-day rolling window)
- Individual ratings (only aggregated)
- Public visibility

### 18.8 Forbidden Poster Reputation Patterns

```javascript
const FORBIDDEN_POSTER_COPY = [
  // Subjective labels
  'Bad poster', 'Problematic', 'Avoid', 'Unreliable',
  
  // Lifetime stats
  'All-time stats', 'Lifetime reputation', 'Total history',
  
  // Individual ratings
  'User X rated this poster', 'Individual feedback',
  
  // Public visibility
  'Public reputation', 'Visible to all'
];

const REQUIRED_POSTER_ELEMENTS = [
  'Tasks posted count',     // Always show if >= 5 tasks
  'Dispute rate',           // Always show (0 disputes is good info)
  'Avg response time',      // Always show
  'Hustler rating',         // Aggregated (Great/Okay/Difficult)
  '90-day window notice'    // "Based on last 90 days" (optional, subtle)
];
```

## §19. Exit With Dignity (Pause State)

Most gig apps trap users psychologically through streak anxiety, FOMO notifications, and punitive decay. This destroys trust and increases churn.

### 19.1 Core Principle

Let users leave **cleanly** without losing progress. No psychological traps.

**Your progress is safe** — XP, levels, trust tier, and badges are protected.

### 19.2 Pause State UI

```

```

### 19.3 Pause State Rules

| Aspect | During Pause | After Resume |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **XP** | No decay | Intact |
| **Level** | Frozen | Intact |
| **Trust Tier** | Frozen | Intact |
| **Badges** | Permanent (no change) | Intact |
| **Streak** | Grace period (configurable) | Continues if resumed in time |
| **Task Visibility** | Hidden from task feed | Restored |
| **Notifications** | None | Restored |

### 19.4 Pause Duration Tiers

| Duration | Streak Grace | Trust Protection |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Up to 14 days** | Full streak preserved | Full protection |
| **15-30 days** | Streak resets to 1 | Trust tier preserved |
| **31-90 days** | Streak resets to 1 | Trust tier preserved |
| **90+ days** | Streak resets to 1 | Trust tier drops one level (max) |

**Note:** Even after 90+ days, XP, Level, and Badges remain intact. Only streak and trust tier are affected.

### 19.5 Paused Account Screen

When account is paused, show:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Account Paused                                         │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Resume Rules:**
- Resume is instant (no "reactivation" delay)
- All protected progress restored immediately
- Task visibility restored
- Notifications restored
- Streak continues if within grace period

### 19.6 Pause Invariants

| ID | Invariant | Enforcement |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| **PAUSE-1** | XP never decays during pause | Backend logic (no XP decay job runs for paused users) |
| **PAUSE-2** | Badges are permanent regardless | DB constraint (badges table has no expiry) |
| **PAUSE-3** | Pause is always available | UI always shows option (Settings or Profile) |
| **PAUSE-4** | Resume is instant | No "reactivation" delay, immediate restoration |
| **PAUSE-5** | No punitive notifications | Notification service skips paused users |
| **PAUSE-6** | Task visibility hidden during pause | Backend query filter (WHERE account_status != 'PAUSED') |

### 19.7 Pause State Display Rules

**Display Context:**
- ✅ ProfileScreen (Pause button, always visible)
- ✅ SettingsScreen (Pause option)
- ✅ PausedAccountScreen (when paused)
- ❌ HomeScreen (when paused, show paused screen instead)
- ❌ Task Feed (hidden when paused)

**Color Rules:**
- Use SUCCESS color (#10B981) for "✅ Protected" items (XP, Level, Trust Tier, Badges)
- Use INFO color (#3B82F6) for "⏸️ Paused" items (Streak)
- Use neutral gray for paused account status
- Use primary color for action buttons ("Resume Account", "Pause My Account")

**Forbidden:**
- Urgency language ("Act now to preserve your streak!", "Hurry!")
- FOMO notifications ("You're missing out on tasks!")
- Punitive language ("Your streak will expire", "Progress will decay")
- Shame language ("You're taking a break", "You're inactive")

### 19.8 Forbidden Pause Patterns

```javascript
const FORBIDDEN_PAUSE_COPY = [
  // Urgency
  'Act now', 'Hurry', 'Limited time', 'Expires soon',
  
  // FOMO
  'Missing out', 'Others are earning', 'You're falling behind',
  
  // Punitive
  'Progress will decay', 'Streak will expire', 'Lose your status',
  
  // Shame
  'You're inactive', 'Taking a break', 'Not participating'
];

const REQUIRED_PAUSE_ELEMENTS = [
  'Protected progress list',  // XP, Level, Trust Tier, Badges
  'Paused items list',        // Streak (with grace period)
  'Resume option',            // Always visible and accessible
  'No urgency',               // Calm, supportive language
  'Clear grace periods'       // When streak grace expires
];
```
