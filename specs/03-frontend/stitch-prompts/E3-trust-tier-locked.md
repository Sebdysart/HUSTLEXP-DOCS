# Screen E3: Trust Tier Locked (Poster + Hustler)
## Purpose: Make trust boring, deterministic, and earned. This is a requirements document, not a marketing screen.

### Screen Purpose (Non-Negotiable)

This screen exists to show **locked trust tier requirements**, not user encouragement.

It must be:
- **Read-only** (requirements document, not application)
- **Deterministic** (no variable interpretation)
- **Non-emotional** (no "almost there!", no promises)
- **Non-interactive** (no bypass, no appeal, no contact)

Make trust **boring, deterministic, and earned**.

This is not a marketing screen. It is a requirements document.

### Stitch Prompt (Hustler Variant)

The Hustler variant is **symmetric** with the following differences:

**Requirements Section (Hustler-specific):**
- ⬜ "10 completed tasks" (instead of 25)
  - Current: "7 completed"
- ⬜ "0 disputes" (instead of 5 reviews)
  - Current: "0 disputes"
- ⬜ "30 days account age" (same)
  - Current: "22 days active"
- ⬜ "Verified ID" (instead of security deposit)
  - Current: "Not verified"

**What This Affects (Hustler-specific):**
- Bullet points:
  • "In-home tasks"
  • "Instant high-priority matching"
  • "Care-related work"
  • "Higher-value task eligibility"

Everything else is identical. The screen is **read-only, non-emotional, non-negotiable**.

### Lock Criteria (Must All Pass)

* ✅ No way to bypass
* ✅ No appeal language
* ✅ No promises
* ✅ No variable interpretation
* ✅ Read-only requirements (requirements document, not application)
* ✅ Factual system language only
* ✅ Explicit requirements shown
* ✅ Single primary action (continue, no "Apply" or "Request")
* ✅ No progress animations (unless backend-defined)

### Design Notes

**Why this matters:**
- Makes trust boring, deterministic, and earned
- Prevents "how do I unlock this?" confusion
- Maintains system authority (requirements document, not application)
- Eliminates bypass attempts and appeals

**Visual Authority:**
- Read-only requirements checklist (requirements document, not application)
- Factual tier description (no emotional framing)
- Current state shown (no progress animations)
- Single primary action (continue, no "Apply" or "Request")

**Behavioral Rules (Enforced by UI):**
- ❌ Cannot bypass requirements (no "Apply" or "Request" buttons)
- ❌ Cannot appeal or contact support (no chat entry point)
- ❌ Cannot edit requirements (read-only checklist)
- ❌ Cannot see progress animations (unless backend-defined)
- ❌ Cannot request manual override (no appeal language)

## Props Interface

```typescript
interface TrustTierLockedProps {
  // Viewer role
  viewerRole: 'POSTER' | 'WORKER';

  // Locked tier info
  lockedTier: {
    name: string;                      // e.g., "In-Home Tasks"
    description: string;               // e.g., "Required for tasks involving private spaces"
  };

  // Requirements checklist (read-only)
  requirements: {
    id: string;
    label: string;                     // e.g., "25 completed tasks"
    currentValue: string;              // e.g., "18 completed"
    isMet: boolean;
  }[];

  // What this affects (factual list)
  affectedFeatures: string[];          // e.g., ["In-home tasks", "Instant high-priority matching"]

  // Callbacks
  onContinue: () => void;

  // Optional
  testID?: string;
}
```

### Data Flow
- Requirements from backend trust tier configuration
- Current values from user profile
- Read-only display, no progress animations
- Single "Continue" action, no bypass
