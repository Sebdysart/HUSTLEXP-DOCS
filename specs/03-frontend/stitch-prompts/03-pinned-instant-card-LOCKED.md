# Screen 3: Pinned Instant Card (Fallback) — LOCKED
## Status: APPROVED — Final Authority Review Passed

**Verdict:** This card serves as the fallback when no active instant tasks exist. It explains Instant Mode value proposition and encourages activation. Clean, informational, not pushy.

**What Works at MAX Tier:**
- ✅ Clear explanation of Instant Mode benefits
- ✅ Simple CTA to enable Live Mode
- ✅ No gamification or urgency tactics
- ✅ Respects user decision not to enable
- ✅ Consistent with Apple Glass aesthetic

**Design Decisions:**
- ✅ Subtle card treatment (not attention-grabbing)
- ✅ Icon-led layout for quick scanning
- ✅ Single CTA, not multiple options
- ✅ Dismissible with "Don't show again" option

**This screen is LOCKED (v1). Do not iterate further.**
