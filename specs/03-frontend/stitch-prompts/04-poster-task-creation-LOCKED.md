# Screen 4: Poster Task Creation — LOCKED
## Status: APPROVED — Final Authority Review Passed

**Verdict:** This screen achieves **guided task creation without friction**. It collects exactly what's needed for matching and escrow while feeling fast and intuitive. No optional fields masquerading as required. No dark patterns.

**What Works at MAX Tier:**
- ✅ Linear flow with clear progress
- ✅ Smart defaults reduce input burden
- ✅ Category selection affects downstream fields
- ✅ Price guidance based on task type and duration
- ✅ Location auto-filled from profile with override option
- ✅ Timing presets (Now, Today, This Week, Custom)
- ✅ Clear escrow explanation before payment

**Critical Elements:**
- **Step 1: What** — Title, category, description
- **Step 2: Where** — Location (defaulted), radius
- **Step 3: When** — Timing preset or custom datetime
- **Step 4: How Much** — Price with AI suggestion, tip toggle
- **Step 5: Review** — Summary with edit ability before posting

**Abuse Resistance:**
- ✅ Minimum price enforced ($5.00)
- ✅ Task description scanned for PII before posting
- ✅ Location must be specific (no "somewhere in Austin")
- ✅ Cannot post while previous task is active (unless premium)

**This screen is LOCKED (v1). Do not iterate further.**
